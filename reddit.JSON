Zero waste is really more of a target and some people get so awesomely close. Yes the girl in the post isn't EXACTLY zero waste, yes she still produces a tiny amount of trash, yes she still probably uses [unbleached recycled-paper] toilet paper (I can't blame her!). But surely a 1 gallon trash filled in a year is damn negligible compared to a 13 gallon trash filled every week!\n\n\nAlso, I think it can be a bit tough to put one's head around the idea of reducing waste(i.e. avoiding useless packaging or avoiding to buy stuff that can't be recycled/composted or re-used). It sounds like a very simple and basic idea (in particular for a subreddit like this one) but we're just so deep into consumerism practices that we don't realize to what extent it's a problem. I've been casually recycling for years without putting too much thoughts into it. I read the zero waste book from Bea Johnson last year and it honestly took me a while to really be aware of all the useless stuff that I buy or all the trash that I produce. I'm no where what she does but such an interesting read and eye opener and every bit helps.\n","author_flair_text":null,"edited":1425168533,"score":2,"archived":false,"id":"cp0cr1a"} {"gilded":0,"name":"t1_cp0cr1b","author_flair_css_class":"recommend","distinguished":null,"created_utc":"1425168000","subreddit_id":"t5_2qmlu","ups":3,"subreddit":"electronic_cigarette","downs":0,"retrieved_on":1427510301,"parent_id":"t1_cp0ck11","score_hidden":false,"id":"cp0cr1b","archived":false,"edited":false,"score":3,"author_flair_text":"Ph'nglui Mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.","body":"You've got to.
